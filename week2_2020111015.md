# Week 2, Lecture 1:
## Summary:-
Today's lecture was a detailed discussion on finding the nth fibonacci number, finding an optimum solution for the above problem and optimizing the solution. Afterwards we found karatsuba's multiplication method to speed up the multiplication method and further discussed how this wasnt the fastest known method.
## Detailed explanation:
When an Algorithm is proposed there are 3 important things to consider:
1. Correctness -> if the algorithm performs the desired task correctly for all test cases
2. Time Complexity -> The time it takes to perform the given tast, the lesser the time taken the more desirable the algorithm.
3. _Can we do better ?_ -> This is an important question to ask, unless a formal proof is given, it is assumed that a better (faster and more efficient in terms of storage) solution is always possible
